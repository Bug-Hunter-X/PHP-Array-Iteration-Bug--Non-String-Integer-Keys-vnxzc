This code snippet demonstrates a common PHP error related to improper handling of array keys during iteration.  The issue arises when using `foreach` loops with array keys that are not strictly integers or strings.

```php
<?php
$data = [
    'a' => 1,
    'b' => 2,
    10 => 3,
];

foreach ($data as $key => $value) {
    //Attempting to use $key as an integer could lead to an error.
    if ($key == 'b'){ // Works fine
      echo "Key is: " . $key . " Value is: " . $value . "\n";
    }
    if ($key === 10){ //Will not work
      echo "Key is: " . $key . " Value is: " . $value . "\n";
    }
}
?>
```
